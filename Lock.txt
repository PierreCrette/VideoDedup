Program : RCT
Test the lock : if lock=free or lock=rct continue else goto retry (lock=other can occurs if other pgm starded few minutes ago. lock=rct can occurs if last run was cancelled in the middle)
Set lock=rct (beware to ensure minimal delay between step 1 and 2)
Wait 3 seconds (to be sure lock is set by current program and not by a simultaneous other. 3s >> delay between steps 1 and 2)
Test the lock : if lock=free or lock=rct continue else goto retry (can occurs if simultaneous pgm overwrite the lock)
Execute function
set lock=free

retry:
    Wait 1 second (to free cpu/system)
    goto step 1
